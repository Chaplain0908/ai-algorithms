'''
forward search:
    beginning at the original state, doing available actions, create new state
    continue expanding until reach the goal state
It is similar to state-action space, actions are controlled by preconditions and effects
What are needed for forward search:
    state: use set to represent the cur world, like {At(A), Has(Banana)}
    action: with preconditions and effects
            Action: Move(x, y)
            Preconditions: At(x)
            Effects: Â¬At(x), At(y)
    planning problem:
            original state: set()
            actions: available actions
            goal state: set()
