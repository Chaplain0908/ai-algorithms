# Background

This project is an AI Algorithm Collection developed based on the CS520 course at Rutgers University, 
and inspired by the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig.

All algorithms in this project are implemented entirely in Python, 
without relying on external libraries for core logic 
(except for the Machine Learning and Neural Network modules, which use PyTorch for model training and fine-tuning).

The aim of this project is to build a self-contained educational framework that supports 
and extends future research in AI planning, probabilistic reasoning, and neural learning.

# Structure

This project is composed of eight main modules:
Search, Constraint, Logic Inference, Planning, Probabilistic, Reinforcement, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks.

Each module generally includes the following components:

- Algorithms – Contains the core implementations of algorithms that can be applied to various problems.
- Problems – Provides classic environments or problem definitions where the algorithms are applied.
- Demos – Offers a unified interface to run the algorithms on the problems and obtain results.
- Visualize – Visualizes the behavior and outcomes of the algorithms for each problem to make the results more intuitive and interpretable.

In this README, I will introduce every algorithm and problem included in the project, covering the background of each problem, 
the goal of the corresponding algorithm, how the algorithm works, and the final results—often visualized to provide a clearer understanding of the solution process.
